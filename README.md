# Research Question: Why Affordable Housing is not "Affordable" at all?
## Abstract
Affordable housing is a key instrument in addressing New York City's housing crisis. Despite numerous policies and incentives, such as programs 421a and 485x, a large portion of NYC residents are still unable to achieve homeownership or secure affordable rentals. This project explores the perception gap between the public, authorities, and media regarding affordable housing and the structural flaws in current housing policies that fail to address the economic realities of the city's population. Understanding these issues will provide actionable insights for improving housing policies and ensuring affordable housing achieves its intended purpose.
