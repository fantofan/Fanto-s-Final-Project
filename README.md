# Research Question: Why Affordable Housing is not "Affordable" at all?
## Abstract
Affordable housing has long been a cornerstone of urban policy, yet its implementation consistently falls short of meeting the needs of low- and middle-income populations. Despite a multitude of initiatives aimed at addressing this challenge, such as tax abatement programs like New York City's 421a and 485x, the persistent inaccessibility of affordable housing raises critical questions. Why do these policies fail to achieve their intended goals, and how do they impact the very communities they aim to serve? This study seeks to explore these questions through the lens of public opinion, particularly as shared on Reddit as a source of public opinion. This choice is driven by the platform's unique role as a forum for candid discussions across diverse socioeconomic and demographic groups. By analyzing these conversations, this study aims to uncover the lived experiences and perceptions of those affected by affordable housing policies.
